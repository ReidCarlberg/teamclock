<h2>Time Clock Administration</h2>

<h3>Initial Configuration</h3>

<p>Note: you must be an owner/admin user to modify time clock records.

<p>Before using the time clock administration functions, you must configure two options in settings.

<p>First, you have to specify your standard payroll period.  Your options are weekly, biweekly, 
semimonthly and monthly.  

<p>Next, you must specify a reference pay period start date.  Pay period reports will be generated relative 
to this date.  

<p>Example: select a pay period type of biweekly and a reference pay period start date of 11/28/2004.  On 12/1/2004, 
your current pay period will have a start date of 11/28/2004 and an end date of 12/11/2004.  On 12/15/2004, your 
current pay period will have a start date of 12/12/2004 and an end date of 12/25/2004.

<h3>Time Clock Entry Modification and Creation</h3>
