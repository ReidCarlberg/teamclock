<h2>Adding Customers, Projects and Tasks</h2>

<p>Customers, Projects and Tasks help you classifly calendar, activity and to do records.  
Your system is initialized with a default record for each of these when you first sign up.
The "Admin" area helps you create and modify all three.  

<p>Keep in mind that projects belong to a customer.  You must add the customer prior to adding 
a project for it.  If you create a project for one customer, you can move it to another
customer.  A customer can have an unlimited number of projects.  

<p>Tasks help you classify activities.  Examples of a task include meeting, admin, development or some
other description of the type of work done independent of customer and project.
